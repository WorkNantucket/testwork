                                maids, dog walkers, butlers, gardeners, cooks, and others who work in or around your private residence, are domestic workers, and as such must be paid at least MA 
                               state minimum wage by law, regardless of national origin or immigration status. Offering a place to live in exchange for said work is not legal.
                               The MA Domestic Workers Law allows for specific deductions in specific amounts.

                               and much more. There is also a <a href="https://www.mass.gov/service-details/labor-trafficking">link to information</a>
                               on how to recognize and report <em>labor trafficking</em>, which is when employers force someone to work using threats, harm, or restraint, 
                               and to which Domestic Workers are particularly susceptible.
                               <br> Full text of the law can be read <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/940-cmr-32-domestic-workers/download">here</a> <small>[PDF 7 pages]</small>.                               <blockquote>REGULATORY AUTHORITY 940 CMR 32.00: M.G.L. c. 149, &#167;190(o).</blockquote>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Domestic Workers are not Independent Contractors, they are Household Employees. The IRS explains this in detail
                                <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/hiring-household-employees"> here</a>. If you decide
                                to employ a person for any type of domestic work in your house in Massachusetts, you must follow the law,
                                or if you use an employment agency, ensure the agency adheres to the law.
                                If you are employed as a Domestic Worker in Nantucket, which is in Massachusetts, and you are not paid at least
                                state minimum, you have the right to submit a claim for unpaid wages, regardless of immigration status.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In Massachusetts, only licensed Employment Agencies can place Domestic Workers. Staffing and placement agencies
                                do not have to be licensed and cannot legally place Domestic Workers. Licensing laws in Massachusetts exist for a reason. Laws requiring licensing in relation to childcare or 
                                domestic workers are especially important.
                                Our children and the people that care for them should be and <em>are</em> held to a greater standard of 
                                care than other activities in this state.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In Nantucket, all of this is critical; domestic workers come from around the globe to the island for 
                                employment during the summer season, as do tourists and seasonal residents that may require the services 
                                of domestic workers including childcare. Many people in both of these
                                populations are likely to be unaware of the legal protections afforded by the state to them and their 
                                loved ones.<a href=""></a>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><em>Parents</em>, the employment agency that supplies you with a domestic
                                worker such as a nanny, aupair, etc must renew their license every year. The agency must carry a license for each location
                                in which they conduct business. You can call the Massachusetts Department of Labor Standards at <a href="tel:6176266970">617-626-6970</a>

                                <em>Domestic workers</em>, it is unlawful for an employment agency
                                to advertise placements or place you in an employment situation without a current local license.
                                Before responding to an ad you should ensure the agency's license is up to date. If you work with an Emigrant Agent, 
                                that agent must be part of a licensed Employment Agency.
